Code book â€” UCI HAR Dataset (measures_average)

Data Set Information:

measures_average data set was created from the experiments that had been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The train data and test data were merged together as a in data set in this cleaning process. the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted, the activities fields in the data were decoded using the descriptive activity names. the data columns were labelled with descriptive variable names. 

measure_average data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
